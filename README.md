# Carpentries Teaching Demo

A repository to host the demo I gave for the Carpentries to complete instructor 
checkout.

## What is the Carpentries?



## Choosing an Episode to Teach

I chose the [Data Frame Manipulation with dplyr](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/12-dplyr.html) episode.

I have previously taught this for a workshop.

I chose from one of the [recommended episodes](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demo_lessons#swc), 
which is a requirement.

## Notes

Below are some notes I gathered on the episode. Refer to the [instructor view](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/instructor/12-dplyr.html) 
for the episode.


### What is dplyr


### Episode Objectives

- To be able to use the six main data frame manipulation ‘verbs’ with pipes in dplyr.
- To understand how `group_by()` and `summarize()` can be combined to summarize datasets.
- Be able to analyze a subset of data using logical filtering.


### Getting Started

Ensure you have `dplyr` installed.

```r
install.packages('dplyr')

library("dplyr")
```
